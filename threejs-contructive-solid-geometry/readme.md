* Click any of the six buttons to generate the examples
* Demonstrations of moderately complex Boolean operations. A work in progress
* Also needs examples showing more basic, simpler operations
	* As well as intersection examples
* Requires a computer that can do some heavy lifting
	* Be prepared to wait for twenty second and more for model to be generated
* Best to reload the page in between drawing each object
